A high-performance industrial anomaly detection system based on the **PatchCore** algorithm. This project uses deep learning to detect defects in manufacturing components (e.g., Leather, Bottles, Metal Nuts, Zippers) with near-perfect accuracy.

The system includes a training pipeline (Jupyter Notebook) and a deployment-ready web application powered by **FastAPI** and **Gradio**.

## 🚀 Training Results

The following results were obtained during model training on the MVTec AD dataset:

| Component    | AUROC | Optimal Threshold | Training Time |
|:------------:|:-----:|:----------------:|:-------------:|
| Leather      | 0.9986| 28.48             | ~19s          |
| Metal Nut    | 0.9839| 35.02             | ~11s          |
| Bottle       | 0.9929| 34.55             | ~13s          |
| Zipper       | 0.9409| 26.60             | ~11s          |

Memory bank size: 15,000 features per component (1,536-dimensional vectors from ResNet50)

## 📊 Comparative Analysis

We conducted a rigorous comparison of PatchCore against other state-of-the-art anomaly detection models, including **Autoencoder**, **EfficientAD**, and **PaDim**.

## 🎯 Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites

- **Docker** (Recommended for deployment)
- **Python 3.10+** (For local development)
- **GPU** (Recommended for training; inference runs efficiently on CPU)

### 2. Generate the Models

The `.pth` model files are not included in this repository to save space. You must generate them first:

1. Open `notebook/patchcore_anomaly_detection.ipynb`
2. Run all notebook cells to:
   - Download the MVTec AD dataset
   - Train PatchCore models for each object class
   - Evaluate performance metrics
3. Trained models (e.g., `patchcore_leather.pth`) will be saved to the `models/` directory

### 3. Run Locally

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Start the FastAPI server:

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

Open your browser to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/gradio` to use the interface.

## 🐳 Running with Docker

This project is containerized for seamless deployment.

### Build and Run

```bash
# Make the build script executable
chmod +x build_and_push.sh

# Build the image (replace 'v1' with your desired tag)
./build_and_push.sh v1

# Run the container
docker run -p 8000:8000 your-image-name
```

Access the app at `http://localhost:8000`

## 🔄 Workflow Overview

**Training Phase** (Jupyter Notebook):
1. Load MVTec AD dataset
2. Extract features using pre-trained ResNet50
3. Build memory bank from normal samples
4. Compute optimal anomaly thresholds
5. Evaluate on test set and save models

**Inference Phase** (FastAPI/Gradio):
1. Load trained model from disk
2. Extract patch-level features from input image
3. Compute nearest-neighbor distances to memory bank
4. Generate anomaly maps and classification results
5. Display results through web interface

## 📝 Notes

- Models are trained on 320×320 resolution images
- Memory banks contain 15,000 feature vectors per component class
- Optimal thresholds are automatically computed during training
- The system supports real-time inference with minimal latency
- All components can be easily extended to support additional object classes
